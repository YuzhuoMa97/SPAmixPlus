# SPAmix+
A scalable, accurate, and universal analysis framework to control for population structure and family relatedness in large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

# Comparision of SPAmix+ and SPA<sub>GRM</sub>

SPAGRM extends SPACox to analyze a study cohort in which subjects can be genetically related to each other. The method is still only valid to analyze a homogeneous population. SPAGRM can lead to false discoveries in analyses of heterogeneous population, although incorporating SNP-derived ancestry PCs as covariates. SPAmix+ can analyze a study cohort in which subjects can be genetically related to each other and from multiple populations.
